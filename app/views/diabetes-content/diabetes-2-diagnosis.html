<h1 class="heading-xlarge">Understanding your diabetes type 2 diagnosis</h1>

<p>You'll need to have some tests to find out whether you have type 2 diabetes. If diagnosed, there are things you can do to help with any shock and confusion you might feel.</p>

<h2 class="heading-large">Test you’ll need to get a diagnosis</h2>

<p>To find out if you have diabetes you usually have to go through the following steps:</p>

<ol class="list-number">
  <li>Speak to your GP about your symptoms.</li>
  <li>If your GP thinks you might have diabetes they may check your urine and ask for a blood test to check your blood sugar levels. It usually takes about X weeks for the blood test results to come back.</li>
  <li>If the tests show that you have diabetes, your GP will ask you to come in again to explain what will happen next. You’ll be most likely be <a href="#">put on medication</a> straight away.</li>
</ol>

<p>Write down any questions you want to ask your GP. Some things you might want to ask could be:</p>

<ul class="list-bullet">
  <li>why could my symptoms mean that I have diabetes?</li>
  <li>why do I have to do a urine and blood test?</li>
  <li>who will do the tests?</li>
  <li>is there anything I should do or avoid in the the meantime, eg certain foods?</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="heading-large">If you’re diagnosed with diabetes</h2>

<p>If your blood test shows that you have diabetes, your GP will ask you to come in for another appointment.</p>

<p>What they’ll talk to you about in the appointment depends very much on the diagnosis and the treatment they’ll recommend.</p>

<p>Generally, they’ll explain the following to you:</p>

<ul class="list-bullet">
  <li>what diabetes is</li>
  <li>what high blood sugar means for your health</li>
  <li>what medication you’ll have to take</li>
  <li>your diet and exercise</li>
</ul>

<p>Your GP might not have much time to explain the diagnosis to you. The appointment might only be 10 to 15 minutes long.</p>

<h2 class="heading-large">Dealing with confusion and shock after the diagnosis</h2>

<p>It’s usually difficult to take everything in the GP tells you during the appointment. You might even be in shock.</p>

<h3 class="heading-medium">Talk to other people</h3>

<p>You should take some time after the diagnosis to talk to family and friends about what the GP told you.</p>

<p>You might want to talk to other people who have diabetes. You can do this through <a href="#">online forums</a> or in <a href="https://www.diabetes.org.uk/How_we_help/Local_support_groups/">support groups</a>.</p>

<p>Hearing how other people manage their diabetes and what changes they had to make to their lifestyle could help you organise how you live with diabetes.</p>

<h3 class="heading-medium">Write down your questions</h3>

<p>During this time write down all the questions you have.</p>

<p><a href="/book-an-appointment">Make another appointment</a> with your GP and take your list of questions with you.</p>

<p>There’s also a lot of <a href="#">information on diabetes</a> available where you can read up on the condition. Some hospitals offer diabetes courses where you can learn more about the condition.</p>

<h2 class="heading-large">What happens after the diagnosis</h2>

<p>Usually the following things happen after your diagnosis:</p>

<ol class="list-number">
  <li>Your GP will prescribe <a href="#">medication</a>. It might take some time for you to get used to the medication and to find the right amounts for you.</li>
  <li>You might need to make changes to your <a href="/diabetes-content/diet">diet and start being active</a>.</li>
  <li>You’ll have to watch your body for certain signs to avoid <a href="/diabetes-content/health-problems-caused-by-diabetes-type-2">other health problems</a>.</li>
  <li>You’ll have to go for <a href="/booking-with-context/going-for-regular-diabetes-check-ups">regular diabetes type 2 check ups</a>.</li>
</ol>
