<h1 class="heading-xlarge">Food and keeping active for people with diabetes type 2</h1>

<p>A healthy diet and keeping active will help you manage your blood sugar levels. They’ll also help you control your weight and make you generally feel better.</p>

<h2 class="heading-large">Eating a healthy diet</h2>

<p>You don’t have to avoid certain foods altogether. You should, however, eat regularly and eat different foods, eg lots of fruit and vegetables and some starchy carbohydrates like bread or pasta. Try to keep the amount of sugar, salt and fat to a minimum.</p>

<p>If you need to change your diet, it might be easier to make changes step by step, rather than replacing everything at once.</p>

<p>The charity Diabetes UK has detailed information on:</p>

</ul>

<p class="panel-indent">Once a year you should go for a <a href="/booking-with-context/going-for-regular-diabetes-check-ups">regular diabetes check</a> to make sure your blood pressure and your cholesterol (blood fats) level are ok.</p>

<h3 class="heading-medium">Help with changing your diet</h3>

<p>If you find it hard to change your diet, you could ask a dietitian to help you. They can help you address certain problems you might have.</p>

<p>Talk to your diabetic nurse about <a href="http://www.freelancedietitians.org/">finding a dietitian</a> and if the cost could be covered through the NHS.</p>

<p>Diabetes UK has lots of <a href="https://www.diabetes.org.uk/Guide-to-diabetes/Enjoy-food/Cooking-for-people-with-diabetes/">recipes for people with diabetes</a> that will help you cook healthy meals.</p>

<p>People in your <a href="https://www.diabetes.org.uk/In_Your_Area/">local diabetes group</a> might also have some cooking tips.</p>

<h2 class="heading-large">Keeping active</h2>

<p>Physical exercise lowers your blood sugar levels so it’s important to keep active if you have diabetes types 2.</p>

<p>You can be active anywhere. Walking, climbing stairs or doing housework can all count as being active. You could also combine being active with other interests, eg do gardening or walk part of the way if you go to watch a football match.</p>

<p>You should aim for 2.5 hours of activity per week. It’s best to be active after meals.</p>

<p>Speak to your GP or diabetes nurse before you start a new activity. They might have to adjust your treatment because exercise will affect your blood sugar level.</p>

<p>The charity Diabetes UK has some <a href="https://www.diabetes.org.uk/Guide-to-diabetes/Managing-your-diabetes/Exercise/">tips on how to get active</a>.</p>

<h2 class="heading-large">Managing your weight</h2>

<p>When you have diabetes type 2 it’s important to manage your weight. Being a healthy weight will make it easier for your body to use the insulin properly and keep your blood pressure and cholesterol (blood fats) at a healthy level.</p>

<p>If you need to lose weight, try and do it slowly over time, about 0.5 to 1 kilo a week.</p>
