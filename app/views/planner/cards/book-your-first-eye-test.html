    <summary>What’s a diabetes eye check?</summary>

    <p>A diabetes eye check looks for damage to your eyes which can lead to
    sight problems and possibly blindness:</p>

    <ul class="list-bullet">
      <li>you get drops in your eyes to enlarge your pupils (temporarily)</li>
      <li>a photo will be taken of the back of your eye</li>
    </ul>
  </details>

  <p>Plan how you’ll get home after the check. Drops can make your eyes can be
  blurry and you shouldn’t drive for a couple of hours afterwards.</p>
