  with type 2 diabetes. Until your blood sugar levels are healthy you should
  have your blood sugar levels checked every 3 months.</p>

  <ul class="list-bullet">
    <li>a blood test for blood sugar and cholesterol levels</li>
    <li>your blood pressure taken</li>
    <li>a urine test for kidney function</li>
    <li>your weight and height measured</li>
  </ul>
